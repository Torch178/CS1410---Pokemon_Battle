# CS1410---Pokemon_Battle

A game program which simulates a battle between two creatures called pokemon. It's a simple program I created to dip my toes into creating interactive object-oriented class objects, each with their own set of stats, and actions (functions). The pokemon class objects have hp stats, strenght stats, and functions for displaying their current and total hp in  basic graphic interface using "@" to represent current hp and "*" to represent lost hp.  The user upon starting the program is prompted to name their pokemon. They are then shown stats and prompted to battle or quit. Each time pokemon battle their strength is determined via random nmber generator. If one has a higher strength than the other pokemon, then the pokemon with lower strength takes damage to their hp. The amount of damage taken is the difference in the randomly generated strength stats between the two pokemon. The game ends when one pokemon reaches 0 or less, or if the user quits. The program then ouputs an appropriate win or loss message.
